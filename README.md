## 🌊 OpenCV-WASM EcoMonitor
High-performance computer vision in the browser using OpenCV, WebAssembly, and Emscripten.
This repository demonstrates a streamlined engineering pipeline for deploying C++ OpenCV applications to the web using WebAssembly (WASM) and automated GitHub Actions workflows.
The project focuses on production-style automation, reproducibility, and lightweight deployment architecture.
## 🛠 Core Technologies
- Engine: C++ / OpenCV 4.x  
- Compiler: Emscripten (EMSDK)  
- Runtime: WebAssembly (WASM)  
- Automation: GitHub Actions  
- Development Tools: Python scripting + HTTP testing pipeline  
## 🏗 Project Goals
- Browser-based computer vision execution  
- Lightweight CI/CD deployment pipeline  
- Experimental research platform for WASM CV workloads  
## 👤 Architecture Philosophy
- Focus on engineering reliability rather than framework hype  
- Transparent build and deployment automation  
- Reproducible research-style development workflow
